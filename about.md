The Arcadian Group has been in the software consulting business
since 2003.  We have always been a small focused group of developers
spread through out the world with a similar mission.  To help our
customer better understand how to develop and maintain their
software products with ease of use.  Our motto is to keep the process as
simple as possible and take the extra time up front to make
the underlying architecture well thought out.
