This post was written later, but this is the day that we started using Material-UI.

# Introduction

We have been working with Material-UI now since the release of
[v1.0.0-beta.3](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.3) on July 29, 2017. Over that time period we have worked on different projects that cover a range of topics. From that experience and knowledge, we have come up with a Material-UI Tutorial that hits the highlights of ideas people need to know.
