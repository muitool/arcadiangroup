This is the day that we started using Material-UI.

# Introduction

I have been working with Material-UI now
since the release of
[v1.0.0-beta.3](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.3) on July 29, 2017. Over that time period I have worked on different projects
that cover a range of topics. From that experience and knowledge, I have come
up with a tutorial that hits the highlights of ideas people need
to know when visualizing JSON data coming from an
[API endpoint](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2122604/what-is-an-endpoint).
