# Introduction

Having just completed the first part of the
**[Material-UI Tutorial](https://stormasm.github.io/mui-tutorial/)**,
we at the Arcadian Group are moving forward with our plans of
the next phase of development.

One of the goals of the Material-UI community from our perspective
is to overtime develop the community in a way that enhances even
further the community's
[Sponsors and Backers](https://material-ui.com/discover-more/backers/).

That is one of the main reasons we are committing some of our resources
to organizing the continued development of the **Material UI Tutorial**.
In a future post we will outline the next steps for the tutorial, but
in this post we will discuss ideas that are pertinent to a sustainable
community.

This document is a living document.  In other words, it can be edited for clarification or modified with better wording and concepts to elucidate these ideas as clearly as possible to the community.

# Jobs

Everyone likes to use their programming skills to be a productive citizen in our society.  We love to program computers and using these skills to make the world a better place is positive energy for everyone.

With that in mind, it would be great to have a jobs board where people can post opportunities that are available in the Material-UI world.  It would be a way to connect people in our community via work.

If someone gets hired, then the hiring entity would be required to contribute back to the community via
[Sponsors and Backers](https://material-ui.com/discover-more/backers/).
For starters, it would be based on the honor system and by doing that
it gives the hiring entity more flexibility as to how much they want to contribute.  Also, we could even enable them to wait and contribute if the person they hired worked out for them.  The jobs do not necessarily have to be long term or full time, but rather could be shorter term projects.

The cool thing about the software behind the jobs board would be that the code would be MIT Licensed and the Arcadian Group would help integrate this code base as part of the next round of the tutorial.  So, it adds another demo or example that people could use to better understand how to build real world applications using Material-UI.

Initially, it could even be hosted as a static web site similar to the  tutorial and the actual jobs postings could be static JSON files similar to the way the
[Material-UI Tutorial](https://stormasm.github.io/mui-tutorial/) is set up today.  In other words, no back end server would be needed.  If in the future, there is more demand for this site then it could be moved a simple hosted platform like Amazon or whatever other recommendations people would have.

In another post we will outline the architecture and design of the jobs boards, but for now we just wanted to get the idea out there.
